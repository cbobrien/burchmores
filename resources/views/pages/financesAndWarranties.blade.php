	<h2>Shortfall Protection</h2>

	An accident or theft involving your vehicle will all too often result in some sort of financial loss, even when your vehicle is comprehensively insured there are usually outstanding amounts that need to be paid.
	<br /><br />	
	The Shortfall Protection insurance is probably the most advanced protection product available and is designed to protect you in a number of ways against unforeseen losses.
